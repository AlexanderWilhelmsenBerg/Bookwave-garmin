# Install the Connect IQ development apps for testing

BookWave has two separate apps: **BookWave Audio** is a music provider that downloads/plays books;
**BookWave Companion** displays phone playback. Installing Companion alone does not enable watch audio.
These are development builds, not Connect IQ Store releases. Physical acceptance is still pending.
Upgrade the phone to the matching BookWave Android APK with device controls before pairing; keep app data.

1. Download the artifacts from the successful [Garmin Verification run](https://github.com/AlexanderWilhelmsenBerg/Bookwave-garmin/actions/workflows/garmin-verification.yml)
   for the source revision recorded in the test report. Choose `audio-provider` and optionally `companion`. Keep the included MIT license/provenance with the downloaded package.
   Match `fenix843mm` to fēnix 8 AMOLED 43 mm or `fenix847mm` to AMOLED 47/51 mm. Do not use either binary on
   Solar, Pro or a different model. The `.iq` package is for store submission; sideload the target-specific `.prg`.
2. Connect the watch by USB and choose its file-transfer/MTP mode if prompted. Open the watch in Explorer.
   Copy `BookWave-audio-provider-<target>.prg` (and optionally the matching Companion `.prg`) into
   **Internal Storage → GARMIN → APPS**. Safely disconnect it. Let installation finish/restart if prompted.
3. On the watch, select **BookWave Audio** from the music providers. Companion appears separately among
   regular apps. Garmin menus vary with firmware. Keep Garmin Connect Mobile installed and the watch
   paired with the Android phone; it carries the BookWave bridge messages.
4. On the watch, open **BookWave Audio → Browse library / Add music**. Leave the setup menu open
   and choose **Use BookWave phone app**. Keep Garmin Connect running and the watch connected.
   Existing on-watch entry remains available through **Enter on watch**.
5. In Android BookWave open **Settings → Playback → Devices → Garmin → Pair watch**. Compare the
   six-digit code, then select **Accept pairing** on the watch. **Cancel** or watch Back rejects it.
   If interrupted, choose **Send new pairing code**; the request expires after two minutes.
   **Cancel pairing** clears the phone request without unbinding an already accepted account.
   Pair an empty provider before downloading; retained unbound media/events cannot be relabelled.
   Once paired, open **WatchShelf Sidecar setup** on the phone. Enter the full public HTTPS Sidecar
   base URL (including any subpath), verify the prefilled current username, and enter your password
   once. **Send setup** sends these to the provider for health/login; passwords are never saved.
   BookWave has discarded the earlier login password, so it cannot fill that password automatically.
   Use Sidecar's URL, not the Audiobookshelf URL. -1002 means an unexpected response content type;
   check the URL and proxy redirects/error pages. A retained watch account refuses a different
   server/username: sync old progress before any deliberate provider reset.
6. Finish one authorized download on the phone. In the expanded watch row choose **New download**,
   then the book. This queues its server item for Sidecar to fetch to the watch; phone audio files are
   not copied. Follow the watch's native Wi-Fi/charging/download prompts. **Queued** is not **Downloaded**.
   A resume download may cache only the remaining audio; the dialog states its saved start position. Check **Downloads**, then test playback with the phone absent and later use **Force sync**.

**Updating development builds:** CI generates a temporary signing key per job/run. Different CI artifacts
are not a stable upgrade identity; do not assume copying a later PRG preserves an installed app's data.
For repeated tests with retained books, build both apps locally using the same retained private developer
key and source revision, then use their target PRGs. Never share/commit the private key. Record the source,
PRG SHA-256, signing-key fingerprint, watch firmware and Android APK before testing. Face-feed consumers also need the same retained developer key (protected complications). The retained account anchor also refuses switching username/server over cached state; sync old progress, then use a fresh provider installation to switch accounts. Uninstalling a provider
can remove its local watch media; sync pending listening progress before doing so.

The face-state publisher is present, but this change builds no watch face. Its cross-app delivery and
battery behavior remain physical tests. See [device tests](device-management-plan.md) GD-01–10 and
[feed tests](watchface-state-plan.md) GF-01–07; Companion transport tests remain separate.

Garmin's official [sideloading guide](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/your-first-app/)
explains the PRG/USB installation workflow. The [SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/) is needed
only for local builds/simulator tests, not copying an already compiled PRG.

Garmin's [device reference](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/device-reference/fenix847mm/) and the pinned SDK device profile group AMOLED 47/51 mm under fenix847mm; size alone does not identify Solar/Pro variants.
