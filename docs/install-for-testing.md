# Install the Connect IQ development apps for testing

BookWave has two separate apps: **BookWave Audio** is a music provider that downloads/plays books;
**BookWave Companion** displays phone playback. Installing Companion alone does not enable watch audio.
These are development builds, not Connect IQ Store releases. Physical acceptance is still pending.
Upgrade the phone to the matching BookWave Android APK with device controls before pairing; keep app data.

**USB upgrades:** copy the matching PRG into GARMIN/APPS using the same filename and application ID.
This replaces that installed application's code; Companion and Audio have different IDs and do not
replace one another. Use the retained-key testing ZIP for repeat upgrades; CI keys are temporary.
Do not uninstall/reset to fix a connection error: that can remove cached audio and pending progress.
Storage retention still needs WD01 verification on the actual firmware. Installation consumes/moves
the PRG on some firmware, so not seeing the copied file afterward does not prove installation failed.

1. Download the artifacts from the successful [Garmin Verification run](https://github.com/AlexanderWilhelmsenBerg/Bookwave-garmin/actions/workflows/garmin-verification.yml)
   for the source revision recorded in the test report. Choose `audio-provider` and optionally `companion`. Keep the included MIT license/provenance with the downloaded package.
   Match `fenix843mm` to fēnix 8 AMOLED 43 mm or `fenix847mm` to AMOLED 47/51 mm. Do not use either binary on
   Solar, Pro or a different model. The `.iq` package is for store submission; sideload the target-specific `.prg`.
2. Connect the watch by USB and choose its file-transfer/MTP mode if prompted. Open the watch in Explorer.
   Copy `BookWave-audio-provider-<target>.prg` (and optionally the matching Companion `.prg`) into
   **Internal Storage → GARMIN → APPS**. Safely disconnect it. Let installation finish/restart if prompted.
3. On the watch, select **BookWave Audio** from the music providers. Companion appears separately among
   regular apps. Garmin menus vary with firmware. Keep Garmin Connect Mobile installed and the watch
   paired with the Android phone; it carries the BookWave bridge messages.
4. On the watch, open **BookWave Audio → Browse library / Add music**. Leave the setup menu open
   and choose **Use BookWave phone app**. Leave the guidance/status view open during Send setup.
   Check build label **TEST 2026-10-08c**. Keep Garmin Connect running and the watch connected.
   Existing on-watch entry remains available through **Enter on watch**.
5. In Android BookWave open **Settings → Playback → Devices → Garmin → Pair watch**. Compare the
   six-digit code, then select **Accept <code>** on the watch. **Cancel** or watch Back rejects it.
   A Garmin platform “Pair with…” permission prompt is not the provider's six-digit comparison menu.
   The reported prompt's origin/installed version remains unverified; use the labelled build and
   confirm the code before accepting the provider binding.
   If interrupted, choose **Send new pairing code**; the request expires after two minutes.
   **Cancel pairing** clears the phone request without unbinding an already accepted account.
   Pair an empty provider before downloading; retained unbound media/events cannot be relabelled.
   Once paired, open **WatchShelf Sidecar setup** on the phone. Enter the Sidecar host
   and optional subpath (HTTPS is supplied if omitted; successful URL is remembered), verify the prefilled current username, and enter your password
   once. **Send setup** sends these to the provider for health/login; passwords are never saved.
   Password-free reuse of the signed-in session is the requested next UX; it remains pending
   exact token-sharing destination approval and the optional Sidecar extension. This current phone
   build still uses the legacy one-time password form; do not mistake the watch capability for delivery.
   Use Sidecar's URL, not the Audiobookshelf URL. In this build -1002 means an unexpected response content type;
   check the URL and proxy redirects/error pages. A retained watch account refuses a different
   server/username: sync old progress before any deliberate provider reset.
   An immediate Download failure is labelled Book details. -20001 means BookWave rejected the JSON
   schema; report the fixed Field label as well as the code. UP/DOWN pages long messages; BACK returns.
   Earlier builds incorrectly reused -1002 for this case, so old codes alone cannot establish cause.
6. Finish one authorized download on the phone. In the expanded watch row choose **New download**,
   then the book. This queues its server item for Sidecar to fetch to the watch; phone audio files are
   not copied. Follow the watch's native Wi-Fi/charging/download prompts. **Queued** is not **Downloaded**.
   A resume download may cache only the remaining audio; the dialog states its saved start position. Check **Downloads**, then test playback with the phone absent and later use **Force sync**.

**Updating development builds:** CI generates a temporary signing key per job/run. Different CI artifacts
are not a stable upgrade identity; do not assume copying a later PRG preserves an installed app's data.
For repeated tests with retained books, build both apps locally using the same retained private developer
key and source revision, then use their target PRGs. Never share/commit the private key. Record the source,
PRG SHA-256, signing-key fingerprint, watch firmware and Android APK before testing. Face-feed consumers also need the same retained developer key (protected complications). The retained account anchor also refuses switching username/server over cached state; sync old progress, then use a fresh provider installation to switch accounts. Uninstalling a provider
can remove its local watch media; sync pending listening progress before doing so.

The face-state publisher is present, but this change builds no watch face. Its cross-app delivery and
battery behavior remain physical tests. See [device tests](device-management-plan.md) GD-01–10 and
[feed tests](watchface-state-plan.md) GF-01–07; Companion transport tests remain separate.

Garmin's official [sideloading guide](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/your-first-app/)
explains the PRG/USB installation workflow. The [SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/) is needed
only for local builds/simulator tests, not copying an already compiled PRG.

Companion shows **BOOKWAVE PHONE** and displays phone snapshots. **START/Menu** opens help and
**BACK** returns/exits. Its library instructions point to **BookWave Audio** in music providers;
Companion has no local audio library. Open BookWave on the phone and Force sync to test PHONE state.
See [current owner findings and WD01–08](testing/watch-setup-diagnostics.md).

Garmin's [device reference](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/device-reference/fenix847mm/) and the pinned SDK device profile group AMOLED 47/51 mm under fenix847mm; size alone does not identify Solar/Pro variants.

## New watch presentation

Companion Help sits beside START (upper right); Exit beside BACK (lower right). Left-side arrow cues
and a page counter identify UP/DOWN whenever full title/author/chapter/status text needs more pages.
Companion Help explains phone Force sync and the separate BookWave Audio offline library. Audio
setup/login/error views use the same BookWave theme and measured wrapping; Books appears only when
the configured provider can enter its library. Read every error page for code, field and fixed reason.
